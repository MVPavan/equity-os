# Code Review

The review protocol for this repository. The spec-reviewer and code-reviewer
agents follow it when dispatched; a coordinator reviewing inline follows the
same sections. Spec compliance is judged before code quality, and the two
verdicts never blend in an initial review.

## Modes and inputs

Every dispatch states a **mode** and supplies its inputs:

| Mode | Who | Sections that bind | Inputs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `spec` | spec-reviewer | Evidence discipline, Do not trust the report, Spec compliance, Severity | brief path, report path, diff package path, global constraints |
| `quality` | code-reviewer | Evidence discipline, Do not trust the report, Code quality, Severity | same |
| `re-review` | code-reviewer | Re-review (role boundaries lift: verdict **every** finding, spec and quality alike) | findings list, brief path, report path, fix package path |
| `inline` | the coordinator itself | all sections, abbreviated to the changed surface | the diff package; BASE = the SCOPE_BASE recorded in the workspace ledger |

## Evidence discipline

- When the dispatch names a **diff package** (commit list + stat + `-U10`
  diff), read it once — its context lines ARE the changed files. Do not Read
  a changed file separately unless a hunk you must judge is cut off
  mid-function, and say so in your report. Do not re-run git commands. If no
  package was provided, fetch the diff yourself:
  `git diff --stat BASE..HEAD` and `git diff BASE..HEAD`.
- Do not crawl the broader codebase. Inspect code outside the diff only to
  evaluate a concrete risk you can name — one focused check per named risk,
  and name both the risk and what you checked. Cross-cutting changes are
  legitimate named risks: changed lock ordering, a changed function or API
  contract, shared mutable state — checking the call sites is the right method.
- The review is **read-only** on this checkout: never mutate the working
  tree, index, HEAD, or branch state.
- The implementer already ran the tests and reported the output. Do not
  re-run the suite to confirm their report. Run a test only when reading the
  code raises a specific doubt no existing run answers — then a focused
  test, never a package-wide suite, race detector, or repeated/high-count
  loop; if heavy validation seems warranted, recommend it in the report
  instead of running it. If you cannot run commands in this environment,
  name the test you would run. Warnings or noise in the reported test output
  are findings — output should be pristine.
- Every finding and every check you would otherwise answer with a bare "yes"
  carries a `file:line` reference.

## Do not trust the report

The implementer's report is unverified claims about the code — possibly
incomplete, inaccurate, or optimistic. Verify the claims against the diff.
Design rationales are claims too: "kept it simple per YAGNI" is the
implementer grading their own work. A stated rationale never downgrades a
finding's severity.

## Spec compliance review

Compare the diff against the brief/plan/requirements on three axes:

- **Missing** — requirements skipped, missed, or claimed without implementing.
- **Extra** — unrequested features, over-engineering, unneeded "nice to haves".
- **Misunderstood** — right feature built the wrong way, wrong problem solved.

Also check: file-scope compliance (owned files only), the relevant invariants
from `.claude/project/invariants.md` (run the concrete command when an
invariant has one), and required tests / verification evidence when the task
asked for them. Be strict about missing work and unrequested extras.

A requirement that cannot be verified from this diff alone (it lives in
unchanged code or spans tasks) is a **⚠️ Cannot verify from diff** item —
report it alongside the verdict with what the coordinator should check;
never broaden your own search instead.

## Code quality review

- **Correctness & design**: clean separation of concerns; proper error
  handling; DRY without premature abstraction; edge cases handled; hidden
  mutation or confusing state flow.
- **Tests**: new/changed tests verify real behaviour, not mocks; the task's
  edge cases are covered; no test asserts nothing. **A change that required
  editing existing tests to keep them passing changed behaviour** — flag it
  unless the task explicitly changed that behaviour.
- **Structure**: one clear responsibility per file with a defined interface;
  units understandable and testable independently; file structure follows
  the plan; flag files this change created large or grew significantly
  (ignore pre-existing size).
- **Project risks**: apply `.claude/project/brief.md` and
  `.claude/project/invariants.md`.
- **Trust boundaries**: when the diff touches untrusted input, authn/authz,
  secrets, uploads/webhooks, external integrations, or LLM/agent features,
  run the **security skill's** review checklist as an additional lens —
  findings report under this skill's severity and output contract.
- **Python-first checks** when relevant: missing/weak tests for risky
  behaviour changes; missing type hints at important boundaries; mutable
  default arguments; bare `except`; swallowed exceptions or missing context
  managers; unsafe config or secret handling; blocking I/O in async code;
  unbounded retries or missing timeouts on external calls; path, shell, or
  deserialization hazards on untrusted input.

Report issues that could cause incorrect behaviour, safety or data-integrity
problems, missing verification, or brittle code at the changed boundary.
Skip stylistic noise that affects neither correctness nor maintainability.

## Severity calibration

Not everything is Critical. **Important** = the change cannot be trusted
until fixed: incorrect or fragile behaviour, a missed requirement, or
maintainability damage you would block a merge over (verbatim duplication of
a logic block, swallowed errors, tests that assert nothing). "Coverage could
be broader" and polish are **Minor**.

If the plan or brief explicitly mandates something this rubric calls a
defect, that IS a finding — report it as Important, labelled
**plan-mandated**. The plan's authorship does not grade its own work; the
human decides.

Acknowledge what was done well before listing issues — accurate praise makes
the rest of the feedback trusted.

## Re-review (after a fix round)

Scope = the findings list + the fix diff, nothing else. Role boundaries do
not apply here: one re-reviewer verdicts every finding in the list, spec and
quality alike. Verdict every
finding **ADDRESSED** or **NOT ADDRESSED** with `file:line` evidence —
"attempted" is not addressed; the specific defect must no longer exist.
Confirm the fix report names the covering tests and shows their output.
Inspect the fix diff for new breakage (with severity). Issues entirely
outside the fix diff go under **Out-of-Scope Observations** — non-blocking,
they do not extend the loop.

## Output formats

The final message is the report itself: begin directly with the verdict.
Every line is a verdict, a finding with `file:line`, or a check you ran —
no preamble, no process narration.

**Spec review:**

```text
Verdict: COMPLIANT | ISSUES_FOUND
⚠️ Cannot verify from diff: <items + what the coordinator should check, or "none">
Requirements: / Scope: / Invariants: / Unexpected extras:
Issues:
1. [severity] file:line — what's wrong, why it matters
```

**Quality review:**

```text
Strengths: <specific>
Issues — Critical (must fix): / Important (should fix): / Minor (nice to have):
  each: file:line, what's wrong, why it matters, fix if not obvious
Verdict: APPROVE | WARNING | BLOCK — 1-2 sentence reasoning
```

**Re-review:**

```text
Finding verdicts: <each — ADDRESSED | NOT ADDRESSED, file:line evidence>
New breakage in fix diff: <severity + file:line, or "none">
Out-of-scope observations: <or "none">
Verdict: all addressed, no new Critical/Important | findings remain open — <list>
```
