description: "Use when the user asks to run one task through named council members with a named judge — several agents/models each solving the same task independently, then consolidated. TRIGGERS: 'model council', 'convene the council', 'have <agents> each take this and <agent> judge', any brainstorming/research/design/review request that names members and a judge. Do NOT run without user-named members and judge — ask for them in chat instead of choosing."

# Model Council

User-named council members each solve the same task independently and blind to each other; a user-named judge consolidates their reports. The deliverable always contains every member's full report AND the judge's consolidation. Unlike `perspective-council` (one model, five lenses), members here are distinct agents/models the user picks.

**Hard requirement:** the user names the members and the judge — every time. If either is missing, ask in plain chat text (never a modal) and wait. Never substitute defaults.

## Member resolution

| User says | Run as |
|---|---|
| fable, fable-max, fable-xhigh | Agent tool, that subagent_type |
| claude/opus (+ max/xhigh/high/medium/low) | Agent tool, matching claude-* type |
| codex, gpt | codex-adapter plugin per `.claude/commands/use-codex.md` |
| anything else | Ask the user how to reach it |

The judge resolves the same way; it gets a fresh agent even if its type matches a member's.

## Process

1. **Brief.** Write one shared task brief: the task, pointers to relevant files/context, constraints, and the deliverable — "a self-contained report: your solution, reasoning, and open questions." Every member receives it verbatim; no per-member steering unless the user asks.
2. **Dispatch.** All members in parallel, one fresh agent each, none sees another's output. Save each report verbatim to `<run-dir>/<member>.md` (default `scratchpad/council/<topic-slug>/`; user may name a path). A member that fails gets one retry, then report the gap loudly — never backfill with your own answer.
3. **Judge.** The judge agent gets the brief plus all reports, attributed by member name. It consolidates — it does not re-solve: where members converge; where they conflict, which position wins, and why; the best-of synthesis / recommended answer; gaps no member covered. Save to `<run-dir>/consolidation.md`.
4. **Deliver.** In chat: the judge's consolidation in full, a one-paragraph position summary per member, and paths to all saved reports. If the reports are short or the user wants everything inline, include them in full. Never truncate or drop a saved report.

## Rules

- Identical brief to every member; independence is the point.
- Judge overrides a majority only with stated reasoning.
- Attribute the judge's inputs by name — anonymization is for `perspective-council`, not here; the user chose these members and wants to compare them.
