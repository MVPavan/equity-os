description: Execute one phase of a workstream roadmap. Thin entry point for the execution skill's phase scope.

# Phase Execution

Invoke the **execution skill** in **phase scope**
(`.claude/skills/execution/SKILL.md` → Phase scope).

- **Input:** phase id and roadmap path, e.g.
  `/phase-execution E --roadmap docs/workstreams/<name>/roadmap.md`. If the
  roadmap is omitted and ambiguous, ask which workstream.
- Workstream-mode auto-approvals do **not** apply here — deep-phase plans
  still require user approval.
