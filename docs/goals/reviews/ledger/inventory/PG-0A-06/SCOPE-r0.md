Fresh structural validation at these exact bytes:
`python3 scripts/equity_os_blueprint/validate_ledger_structural.py --repo-root .`
→ exit `0` (run at review time).

## Reviewed inventory, exactly as read

`review_inventory_projection(row, "SCOPE")` — canonical JSON. The projection
function was extracted from the checked-in structural validator by `ast`
(recording design r2 §3.3), so the bytes below are the validator's own
projection, not a transcription:

```json
{"activation_predicate":null,"disposition_refs":[],"gate_refs":[],"related_register_ids":["A-04"],"scope_derivation":{"authority_effect":null,"derived_program_disposition":"REQUIRED_NOW","related_register_ids":["A-04"],"rule":"RELATED_REGISTER_SCOPE"}}
```

Digests observed at review time, **pre-record** (the recorder recomputes
`reviewed_input_sha256` after its Phase A evidence append, recording design r2
§3.4 — appending review evidence mutates `evidence_refs` and therefore the input
projection):

- `reviewed_input_sha256` (pre-record): `c85fa3dd67fa5e3fc7411a0cfc1e683a0704e1ab31a15cd992980bb060f4b18e`
- `reviewed_inventory_sha256` (pre-record): `175e5ec6d98a26b3c028d121e843c13daa4da152dcd571a62e6eb55d88e788c3`

## Scope of this decision

Per recording design r2 §2.2 and the `SCOPE` review definition, this review
decides whether this component's scope derivation is correct: right kind, right
source anchor, right related register IDs, right disposition and gate refs, and
whether `scope_derivation.semantic_review` is the applicable review slot. The
`SCOPE` inventory projection (`validate_ledger_structural.py:292-305`, goal
L431-432) covers `scope_derivation` minus `semantic_review`, `disposition_refs`,
`gate_refs`, `activation_predicate`, and `related_register_ids`. For a
`phase_gate_clause` the kind-specific keys `applicable_spec_ids` and
`source_register_ids` are *rejected* keys (goal L230-232), so the derivation
object is exactly the four common keys. This review does **not** cover
`required_evidence`, `evidence_refs`, or `required_approvals`; those are decided
by this component's separate `EVIDENCE` and `APPROVAL` reviews.

## The source occurrence, re-read this round

`docs/blueprint/funda-blueprint-implementation-decision-register-v2.md` line 131,
under `### Phase 0A may exit only when` (register v2 L124), inside `## F. Phase-gate scorecard` (L122); `source_title` "Phase 0A gate clause 6",
`source_anchor` `F-0A-06`:

> - the provisional output contract exists;

Recomputed this round against current bytes:

- `source_hash` over the whole register file → `26d51b31…`, equal to the stored value.
- `text_digest` over the normalized L131-131 span (`"\n".join(lines[130:131]).strip(" \t\n\r\f\v")`,
  the exact rule at `validate_ledger_structural.py:174-176`) → `d80e3d4f1243ddfa383752b7188d653836b63d846240a0cc88689f3fec1d7c4d`,
  equal to the stored value.
- `EV-PG-0A-06-SOURCE.content_sha256` recomputed over the same span → `d80e3d4f1243ddfa383752b7188d653836b63d846240a0cc88689f3fec1d7c4d`,
  equal to the stored value.
- `required_acceptance_text` equals that span with the `- ` list marker and the
  terminal `;` removed, byte for byte.
- Anchor uniqueness holds ledger-wide: `(funda-blueprint-implementation-decision-register-v2.md, F-0A-06)` occurs once
  across all 213 rows, and so does the span `(131, 131)` — both recomputed this round
  (`validate_ledger_structural.py:179-180`).

## Reasoning

**Kind.** `phase_gate_clause` is correct. The occurrence is a bullet in the
register's `## F. Phase-gate scorecard` (L122) under a `### Phase … may exit
only when` heading — i.e. a phase exit condition. It is not a `register_row`
(no ID / Priority / Status cells; `register_id`, `priority`, `source_status`,
and `activation_source_status` are all `null`, as the kind requires), not a
`disposition_item` (those are `### <id> — <title>` findings in the disposition
report carrying an explicit "**Disposition:**" verdict and
`rule=AUTHORITATIVE_OCCURRENCE`), and not a `sequence_clause` (those are the
numbered steps of the disposition report's `## 8. Recommended sequence`). Goal
L141 fixes the population as "One object per bullet in v2 §F", count 35;
`validate_ledger_structural.py:362` pins that count and I recounted 35 this
round.

**Rule.** Goal L239 permits exactly two rules for this kind:
`RELATED_REGISTER_SCOPE` or `ACTIVE_NEGATIVE_CONTROL`. `ACTIVE_NEGATIVE_CONTROL`
is wrong here: goal L263-264 defines it as a control that "activates no
capability: it proves that named capabilities stay dormant or rejected", and the
one clause in §F with that shape is `PG-1-11` (L160, "GBrain, debate,
backtesting, and execution remain outside the release unless separately
approved"), which is indeed the only row in the ledger carrying it. This clause
requires a capability to be *delivered*, not to stay out, so
`RELATED_REGISTER_SCOPE` is the correct and only remaining rule.
`authority_effect` is `null`, which `RELATED_REGISTER_SCOPE` requires
(`validate_ledger_structural.py:1550-1551`).

**`related_register_ids` = `["A-04"]`, and the sharp point is *which half* of
A-04.** A-04 (register L34) is "Freeze the first output contract", and its
acceptance column is explicitly two-staged: "A **provisional v0 exists before
baseline**; final contract after baseline includes event/cutoff, facts, changes,
driver analysis, management ledger, thesis impact, observable falsifiers, open
questions, calculations, memory draft, and approval record". The Phase 0A clause
binds only the first stage — "the provisional output contract exists" — matching
A-04's first stage word for word ("provisional", "exists"). The second stage is
explicitly *after* baseline and so cannot be a Phase 0A exit condition; A-04's
own dependency cell says "A-03 for final freeze".

**A deliberate absence, checked and not a defect of this row.**
`REG-A-04.gate_refs == ["PG-0A-06"]` — no Phase 0.5 or Phase 1 gate claims A-04
for the *final* contract. I checked §F directly: there is no bullet for the final
output contract in any phase block. The ledger mirrors §F exactly (goal L141,
"One object per bullet in v2 §F") and must not invent a bullet the authority does
not contain, so this is a property of the source, not an error in this
component's derivation. It is out of this review's remit and I record it only so
a later reader does not mistake it for an omission here.

**Contrary candidates, considered and rejected.** `B-01` and `B-07` both list
A-04 as a dependency and both concern contracts, but they are Phase 0.5 decisions
whose subject is the workflow and the deterministic-compute list, not the output
contract.

**Aggregation → `REQUIRED_NOW`.** `REG-A-04` is `REQUIRED_NOW`
(`source_status=Open`); single-element aggregate is `REQUIRED_NOW` under goal
L248-250. Stored values agree.

**`disposition_refs` = `[]`.** I checked the populated populations rather than
assuming. Across the 169 canonical rows `disposition_refs` is nonempty on exactly
three closed sets — the 32 `disposition_item` self-identifications, 56
`register_row` crosswalk entries, and the 8 `SCALE-*` rows — and empty on all 73
rows of the remaining four kinds, including all 35 phase-gate clauses. The
convention is that a disposition-report finding is crosswalked to the *register
decisions* it changes, and a gate clause inherits that linkage through its
related registers rather than duplicating it: here `A-04` → `G-1`, `G-5`, `R-4`, `6.2`. That inheritance
is live — for example the disposition report's own T-2 (L274, "Success metrics
are scattered") ends "All phase gates should reference this contract" (L291) and
is carried on `A-07`, `A-12`, and `A-13`, reached from the gate side through
`related_register_ids`. Duplicating those IDs onto this row would mix the two
axes goal L233-235 keeps apart, and would not be an exact source semantic of this
clause.

**`gate_refs` = `[]`.** `gate_refs` is a register-side back-reference, not a
self-reference. `validate_ledger_structural.py:2659-2666` builds `gate_map` *from*
`phase_gate_clause` rows' `related_register_ids` and asserts equality only
against `register_rows`; nothing constrains `gate_refs` on a non-register row. I
recomputed the map this round: 39 register rows carry gate refs, the map matches
every one of them exactly, and **0 of the 109 non-register canonical rows carry
any**. `[]` is the correct and uniform value here.

**`activation_predicate` = `null`.** Required, not optional. Goal L288-290: "A
component whose derived disposition is `REQUIRED_NOW` — including one that became
`REQUIRED_NOW` by related-register aggregation — has `activation_predicate=null`",
and goal L265-267 repeats it for this kind specifically. `activation_record` and
`activation_source_status` are likewise `null`. Goal L292-294 forbids any
"phase-gate exemption" to this rule, so the value is forced.

**Applicable review slot.** This is a non-register canonical row, so
`validate_ledger_preimplementation.py:200-204` appends `SCOPE` to its checks
(`SCOPE` is appended only `if row["kind"] != "register_row"`).
`scope_derivation.semantic_review` is present, non-`null`, `status=PENDING`, with
exactly the 10-key `PENDING` set and no role-binding keys — verified this round.
It is the applicable slot, and it is the slot this review is written against.

**Spec ownership.** `primary_spec` is `null`, which goal L184 permits "only when
`scope_derivation` explicitly supplies program-wide or related-register
ownership" — `RELATED_REGISTER_SCOPE` supplies exactly that. `applicable_spec_ids`
is absent because goal L230-232 makes it a *rejected* key for every kind except
`disposition_item` and `sequence_clause`; the validator enforces the exact key set
at `:1519-1520`. So this gate owns no spec artifact, and cannot.

**Residuals.** None.

This review authorizes no delivery, gate, approval, or transition. It records
only that this component's scope derivation is correct at the input bytes pinned
above.
