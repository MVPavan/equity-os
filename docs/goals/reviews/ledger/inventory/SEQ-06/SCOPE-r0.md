## Reviewed inventory, exactly as read

`review_inventory_projection(row, "SCOPE")` — canonical JSON, extracted from the
checked-in structural validator by `ast` (recording design r2 §3.3) so the
projection is the validator's own, not a transcription:

```json
{"activation_predicate":null,"disposition_refs":[],"gate_refs":[],"related_register_ids":[],"scope_derivation":{"applicable_spec_ids":["S05"],"authority_effect":null,"derived_program_disposition":"REQUIRED_NOW","related_register_ids":[],"rule":"PROGRAM_WIDE_ACTIVE_CONTROL","source_register_ids":["A-03","A-11"]}}
```

Digests observed at review time, **pre-record** (the recorder recomputes
`reviewed_input_sha256` after Phase A, recording design r2 §3.4):

- `reviewed_input_sha256` (pre-record): `f078047cad420b4ee11f92166cb3c2ed9828284310c2b0dc2e92e6306d9b2ee3`
- `reviewed_inventory_sha256` (pre-record): `5aeecd5a34a2d5341d77a184da6ce1e0ae59c0be1d84c03fc7f5eb6fbe6e7d32`

## Scope of this decision

Per recording design r2 §2.2 and the `SCOPE` review definition, this review
decides whether this component's scope derivation is correct: right kind, right
source anchor, right related register IDs, right disposition and gate refs, and
whether `scope_derivation.semantic_review` is the applicable review slot. The
`SCOPE` inventory projection (`validate_ledger_structural.py:293-305`) covers
`scope_derivation` minus `semantic_review`, `disposition_refs`, `gate_refs`,
`activation_predicate`, and `related_register_ids` — so for a `sequence_clause`
it also covers the kind-specific keys `source_register_ids` and
`applicable_spec_ids` (goal L230-231). It does **not** cover `required_evidence`,
`evidence_refs`, or `required_approvals`; those are decided by this component's
separate `EVIDENCE` and `APPROVAL` reviews.

## The source occurrence, re-read this round

`docs/blueprint/funda-third-order-review-disposition-report.md` line 456, within
`## 8. Recommended sequence` (L447); `source_title` "Recommended sequence step 6", `source_anchor`
`SEQUENCE-06`:

> 6. **A-03 and A-11:** perform the manual baseline on Quarter 0 and author the bootstrap thesis; reserve Quarters 1–3 for assisted updates.

`text_digest` and `EV-SEQ-06-SOURCE.content_sha256` were both recomputed over the
normalized L456-456 span → `11b153fe…`, matching the stored values, and
`source_hash` recomputed over the whole disposition report → `a9021c15…`, matching.

## Reasoning

**Kind and derivation rule.** `sequence_clause` is correct: the occurrence is a
numbered step of the disposition report's `## 8. Recommended sequence` (L447),
introduced by "The clean sequence is:" (L449). It is not a `disposition_item`
(those are the `### <id> — <title>` findings with an explicit
"**Disposition:**" verdict, and carry `rule=AUTHORITATIVE_OCCURRENCE`), not a
`phase_gate_clause` (it states no exit condition), and not a `register_row` (it
has no register ID, priority, or Status cell; `register_id`, `priority`, and
`source_status` are all `null`). Goal L244 fixes the rule for the kind as
`PROGRAM_WIDE_ACTIVE_CONTROL`, and goal L247 makes that rule always derive
`REQUIRED_NOW` with no related register IDs; `validate_ledger_structural.py:1512`
and `:2499-2506` assert exactly that. The stored values match, and the
substantive check the rule leaves open passes: a recommended program sequence
orders the whole program, so it is program-wide by construction rather than
scoped to any one register decision.

**`related_register_ids` = `[]`, and why that is not a loss.** This is the one
place a sequence clause is easy to get wrong, because the clause visibly names
register IDs. Goal L233-235 keeps the two axes apart: `related_register_ids` is
*source semantics* and `applicable_spec_ids` is *artifact applicability*, and
"neither may be padded or inferred from the other". `PROGRAM_WIDE_ACTIVE_CONTROL`
forbids related register IDs outright (goal L247), so the register IDs the clause
names are carried in the kind-specific `source_register_ids` key instead
(goal L230-231). The information is therefore preserved, in the field the
contract assigns to it, and `[]` here is required rather than merely permitted.

**`source_register_ids` = `["A-03","A-11"]`, verified against the clause.** Two
IDs, two obligations: "perform the manual baseline on Quarter 0" is `A-03`;
"author the bootstrap thesis" is `A-11`. The trailing "reserve Quarters 1–3 for
assisted updates" is a reservation clause — it constrains what Quarters 1–3 are
*for* without demanding them at this step, and correctly contributes no `B-02`
reference; `B-02` is sourced at `SEQ-10`, where the updates are actually produced.
`validate_ledger_structural.py:2485` pins the same pair.

**`applicable_spec_ids` = `["S05"]`, and the single entry is right even though two
registers are named — verified, because this is the row where a padding error
would be easiest to miss.** `A-03` is inventoried on `REG-A-03`, approval scope
`"A-03 under S05: Define and perform the manual baseline workflow"`; `A-11` is
inventoried on `REG-A-11`, approval scope
`"A-11 under S05: Author and approve bootstrap thesis for the discovery company"`.
Both spec drafts are
`docs/specs/equity-os-s05-discovery-company-vertical-slice.md`. Two registers, one
owning spec, so the closure is `{S05}` — a single-element list is the correct
answer, not a truncation. This row is therefore *not* one of the four affected by
the multi-spec finding, and I confirmed that by resolving both registers rather
than by counting IDs.

**Source anchor and span.** `SEQUENCE-06` at L456-456. `text_digest` recomputed
over the normalized span → `11b153fe…`, matching; `required_acceptance_text`
equals that span byte for byte, including the en dash in "Quarters 1–3". Anchor
and span unique within the source path.

**`disposition_refs` and `gate_refs`, both `[]`.** `gate_refs` is a
register-row-only field: it is pinned by the `gate_map` equality at
`validate_ledger_structural.py:2655-2664`, which computes it from
`phase_gate_clause` rows and compares it only against `register_rows`; all 109
non-register canonical rows carry `[]`. For `disposition_refs` I checked the
populated populations rather than assuming: it is nonempty on exactly three
closed sets — 56 register rows via the curated crosswalk, the 32 `DISP-*`
self-identifications, and the 8 `SCALE-*` rows pinned at `:2652-2653`. All 73
other canonical rows, including every sequence clause, carry `[]`. Section 8 of
the disposition report is a recommendation section, not a numbered finding, so
there is no `<id>` for a sequence step to reference. `[]` is correct.

**`activation_predicate` = `null`.** Required: goal L288-290 permits an
activation predicate only on a component that is not already `REQUIRED_NOW`, and
`PROGRAM_WIDE_ACTIVE_CONTROL` forces `REQUIRED_NOW`. `activation_record` and
`activation_source_status` are likewise `null`.

**Applicable review slot.** This is a non-register canonical row, so
`validate_ledger_preimplementation.py:200-204` appends `SCOPE` to its checks
(`SCOPE` is appended only `if row["kind"] != "register_row"`).
`scope_derivation.semantic_review` is present, non-`null`, `status=PENDING`, with
exactly the 10-key `PENDING` set and no role-binding keys. It is the applicable
slot, and it is the slot this review is written against.

**Cross-check.** `derived_program_disposition` = `program_disposition` =
`REQUIRED_NOW`; `authority_effect` `null`; `delivery_status` `SPEC_DRAFT` with no
open findings.

**Residuals.** None.

**verdict: CLEAN**

This review authorizes no delivery, gate, approval, or transition. It records
only that `SEQ-06`'s scope derivation is correct at the input bytes pinned
above.
