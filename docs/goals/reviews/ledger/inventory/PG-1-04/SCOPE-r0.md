Claude Opus 5 at high effort, in an agent and context independent of any
`IMPLEMENTER` that produced the reviewed content. The digest above is the
`CONTEXT.md` bytes at review time and is an immutable historical capture.

## Reviewed inventory, exactly as read

`review_inventory_projection(row, "SCOPE")` — canonical JSON. The projection
function was extracted from the checked-in structural validator by `ast`
(recording design r2 §3.3), so the bytes below are the validator's own
projection, not a transcription:

```json
{"activation_predicate":null,"disposition_refs":[],"gate_refs":[],"related_register_ids":["C-08"],"scope_derivation":{"authority_effect":null,"derived_program_disposition":"REQUIRED_NOW","related_register_ids":["C-08"],"rule":"RELATED_REGISTER_SCOPE"}}
```

Digests observed at review time, **pre-record** (the recorder recomputes
`reviewed_input_sha256` after its Phase A evidence append, recording design r2
§3.4 — appending review evidence mutates `evidence_refs` and therefore the input
projection):

- `reviewed_input_sha256` (pre-record): `e73540c56859228c8c11c17f54b741d11d753b8c65b0bef15e4b67843de03eec`
- `reviewed_inventory_sha256` (pre-record): `55bab4483f9a4c4fd8e0c794536f35b579d9ed3a4d6e5f9eeddc2440d51b7585`

## Scope of this decision

Per recording design r2 §2.2 and the `SCOPE` review definition, this review
decides whether this component's scope derivation is correct: right kind, right
source anchor, right related register IDs, right disposition and gate refs, and
whether `scope_derivation.semantic_review` is the applicable review slot. The
`SCOPE` inventory projection (`validate_ledger_structural.py:292-305`, goal
L431-432) covers `scope_derivation` minus `semantic_review`, `disposition_refs`,
`gate_refs`, `activation_predicate`, and `related_register_ids`. For a
`phase_gate_clause` the kind-specific keys `applicable_spec_ids` and
`source_register_ids` are *rejected* keys (goal L230-232), so the derivation
object is exactly the four common keys. This review does **not** cover
`required_evidence`, `evidence_refs`, or `required_approvals`; those are decided
by this component's separate `EVIDENCE` and `APPROVAL` reviews.

## The source occurrence, re-read this round

`docs/blueprint/funda-blueprint-implementation-decision-register-v2.md` line 153,
under `### Phase 1 may exit only when` (register v2 L148), inside `## F. Phase-gate scorecard` (L122); `source_title` "Phase 1 gate clause 4",
`source_anchor` `F-1-04`:

> - missing inputs fail closed;

Recomputed this round against current bytes:

- `source_hash` over the whole register file → `26d51b31…`, equal to the stored value.
- `text_digest` over the normalized L153-153 span (`"\n".join(lines[152:153]).strip(" \t\n\r\f\v")`,
  the exact rule at `validate_ledger_structural.py:174-176`) → `301f510a422dcd06974fe1c7e2dfbc542af662e82a7333f7911355f4182006f4`,
  equal to the stored value.
- `EV-PG-1-04-SOURCE.content_sha256` recomputed over the same span → `301f510a422dcd06974fe1c7e2dfbc542af662e82a7333f7911355f4182006f4`,
  equal to the stored value.
- `required_acceptance_text` equals that span with the `- ` list marker and the
  terminal `;` removed, byte for byte.
- Anchor uniqueness holds ledger-wide: `(funda-blueprint-implementation-decision-register-v2.md, F-1-04)` occurs once
  across all 213 rows, and so does the span `(153, 153)` — both recomputed this round
  (`validate_ledger_structural.py:179-180`).

## Reasoning

**Kind.** `phase_gate_clause` is correct. The occurrence is a bullet in the
register's `## F. Phase-gate scorecard` (L122) under a `### Phase … may exit
only when` heading — i.e. a phase exit condition. It is not a `register_row`
(no ID / Priority / Status cells; `register_id`, `priority`, `source_status`,
and `activation_source_status` are all `null`, as the kind requires), not a
`disposition_item` (those are `### <id> — <title>` findings in the disposition
report carrying an explicit "**Disposition:**" verdict and
`rule=AUTHORITATIVE_OCCURRENCE`), and not a `sequence_clause` (those are the
numbered steps of the disposition report's `## 8. Recommended sequence`). Goal
L141 fixes the population as "One object per bullet in v2 §F", count 35;
`validate_ledger_structural.py:362` pins that count and I recounted 35 this
round.

**Rule.** Goal L239 permits exactly two rules for this kind:
`RELATED_REGISTER_SCOPE` or `ACTIVE_NEGATIVE_CONTROL`. `ACTIVE_NEGATIVE_CONTROL`
is wrong here: goal L263-264 defines it as a control that "activates no
capability: it proves that named capabilities stay dormant or rejected", and the
one clause in §F with that shape is `PG-1-11` (L160, "GBrain, debate,
backtesting, and execution remain outside the release unless separately
approved"), which is indeed the only row in the ledger carrying it. This clause
requires a capability to be *delivered*, not to stay out, so
`RELATED_REGISTER_SCOPE` is the correct and only remaining rule.
`authority_effect` is `null`, which `RELATED_REGISTER_SCOPE` requires
(`validate_ledger_structural.py:1550-1551`).

**`related_register_ids` = `["C-08"]`, on a verbatim match.** C-08 (register L79)
is "Implement minimum deterministic calculations", acceptance "Growth, margins,
cash conversion, leverage, dilution/share count, guidance comparison, and
reconciliation traces pass tests and **fail closed**". The clause is "missing
inputs fail closed". The operative phrase is identical, and C-08 is the only
register row in v2 whose acceptance contains it in the Phase 1 block.

**Contrary candidate, considered and rejected.** `B-07` ("Define minimum
deterministic compute", acceptance "Approved MVP list with input, trace,
code-version, **missing-input**, and reproducibility contracts") is the nearest
miss, because it is the only register row that names "missing-input" explicitly.
It is rejected on phase and on role: B-07 is the Phase 0.5 decision that *defines*
the missing-input contract, C-08 is the Phase 1 decision that *implements* it and
lists B-07 as its dependency. A Phase 1 exit condition asks whether the
implementation fails closed. Consistently with that, `REG-B-07.gate_refs` is
empty — §F contains no bullet for the definition itself — so adding B-07 here
would invent an edge rather than record one.

**Back-reference verified.** `REG-C-08.gate_refs == ["PG-1-04", "PG-1-06"]`; both
edges are claimed from the gate side and the `gate_map` equality holds. C-08
serving two Phase 1 gates is not double-booking: this gate takes its
fail-closed conjunct, `PG-1-06` takes its replay-class conjunct.

**Aggregation → `REQUIRED_NOW`.** `REG-C-08` is `REQUIRED_NOW`
(`source_status=Open`); single-element aggregate is `REQUIRED_NOW`. Stored values
agree.

**`disposition_refs` = `[]`.** I checked the populated populations rather than
assuming. Across the 169 canonical rows `disposition_refs` is nonempty on exactly
three closed sets — the 32 `disposition_item` self-identifications, 56
`register_row` crosswalk entries, and the 8 `SCALE-*` rows — and empty on all 73
rows of the remaining four kinds, including all 35 phase-gate clauses. The
convention is that a disposition-report finding is crosswalked to the *register
decisions* it changes, and a gate clause inherits that linkage through its
related registers rather than duplicating it: here `C-08` → `G-1`, `6.9`. That inheritance
is live — for example the disposition report's own T-2 (L274, "Success metrics
are scattered") ends "All phase gates should reference this contract" (L291) and
is carried on `A-07`, `A-12`, and `A-13`, reached from the gate side through
`related_register_ids`. Duplicating those IDs onto this row would mix the two
axes goal L233-235 keeps apart, and would not be an exact source semantic of this
clause.

**`gate_refs` = `[]`.** `gate_refs` is a register-side back-reference, not a
self-reference. `validate_ledger_structural.py:2659-2666` builds `gate_map` *from*
`phase_gate_clause` rows' `related_register_ids` and asserts equality only
against `register_rows`; nothing constrains `gate_refs` on a non-register row. I
recomputed the map this round: 39 register rows carry gate refs, the map matches
every one of them exactly, and **0 of the 109 non-register canonical rows carry
any**. `[]` is the correct and uniform value here.

**`activation_predicate` = `null`.** Required, not optional. Goal L288-290: "A
component whose derived disposition is `REQUIRED_NOW` — including one that became
`REQUIRED_NOW` by related-register aggregation — has `activation_predicate=null`",
and goal L265-267 repeats it for this kind specifically. `activation_record` and
`activation_source_status` are likewise `null`. Goal L292-294 forbids any
"phase-gate exemption" to this rule, so the value is forced.

**Applicable review slot.** This is a non-register canonical row, so
`validate_ledger_preimplementation.py:200-204` appends `SCOPE` to its checks
(`SCOPE` is appended only `if row["kind"] != "register_row"`).
`scope_derivation.semantic_review` is present, non-`null`, `status=PENDING`, with
exactly the 10-key `PENDING` set and no role-binding keys — verified this round.
It is the applicable slot, and it is the slot this review is written against.

**Spec ownership.** `primary_spec` is `null`, which goal L184 permits "only when
`scope_derivation` explicitly supplies program-wide or related-register
ownership" — `RELATED_REGISTER_SCOPE` supplies exactly that. `applicable_spec_ids`
is absent because goal L230-232 makes it a *rejected* key for every kind except
`disposition_item` and `sequence_clause`; the validator enforces the exact key set
at `:1519-1520`. So this gate owns no spec artifact, and cannot.

**One field deliberately outside this decision.** This row carries
`human_review_id = "HR-0004"`. That field is in the `APPROVAL` inventory
projection (goal L435-436), not the `SCOPE` one, so it is decided by this
component's `APPROVAL` review and not here. I note only that it is not part of
the scope derivation and does not affect any judgment above.

**Residuals.** None.

**verdict: CLEAN**

This review authorizes no delivery, gate, approval, or transition. It records
only that this component's scope derivation is correct at the input bytes pinned
above.
